Project Title: Student Community App
Description:Student Community, a community-driven application, enables students to come together and indulge in different types of activities, ranging from attending various events organized by the college and other students to helping each other by sharing important resources such as books, accommodation, etc., and information regarding them. Instead of one-way communication, the Student Community supports supervised two-way communication by allowing even students to post about their events and resources to greater student engagement. By using this application, students can stay informed about essential information about the college and many others that can affect their daily lives. To further student engagement, they will get points or certain perks whenever they have attended any important event that can be used to redeem certain rewards.
